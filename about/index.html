			A united humanity in the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating eastward,
			comes to the land of Shinar (שנער‎). There they agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven.
			God, observing their city and tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other,
			and scatters them around the world.

			I am Jacques Couvreur, founder of <a href="http://inagua.ch">inagua</a>, a company about software development.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am working in software development since 2000... No, it is not a bug!
		</p>
		<p>
			I capitalize my learning in writing articles, like my initial wiki
			<a href="http://agora.2ia.net" target="_blank">2ia.net agora</a> or the initial project of this one:
			<a href="http://ioskit.io" target="_blank">iOS-K.it</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			As I am learning a new language, I decided to create this project: comparing languages, especially as
			Object Oriented or Functional programmings, it seems to be a good way for me to learn them.
