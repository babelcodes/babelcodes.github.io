> TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical 
superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator 
of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript 
applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution.
> 
> TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and __<u>compiles</u>__ to JavaScript. 
__<u>As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs</u>__.

-- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)

One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural subtyping”.
